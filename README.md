# Description
Title: React Employee Contact List

Name: Lawrence Eadie

Overview: This repository is going to add/delete Employee Contact Information for customers in a simulated real world application

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, React

Ideas for future improvement: Change to controlled components, allow users to upload attachments rather than enter one by one, and use reactstrap to expand to additional data collection

# User Stories
User story 1 - as a customer of XYZ corp, I want to enter my current employees and delete previous employees, so that I can rest easy our access and permissions are updated
User story 2 - as a data analyst, I want customers to keep their employee list updated themselves, saving my time for more important activities.
User story 3 - as a business owner, I want to transfer accountability for updating employee lists to customers, so that I can free up resources and transfer security risk
